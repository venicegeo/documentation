Pelias is an open-source [geocoder](glossary.md) for fast and accurate global search. It takes input text, such as the name of a place, point of interest, or address, and returns a latitude/longitude location on the Earth's surface for that place.

Pelias provides place and address search against several datasets, including NGA’s Geographic Names Database (GNDB), geonames.org, the Who’s On First (WOF) [gazetteer](glossary.md), OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses, and administrative boundary (polygon) data to support search and filtering of results based on geometry types.
